# Bugs - 
# Challenges -
#       1) Generate the costs for each of the items on the menu.
#       2) Calculate the total cost for all items.
#       3) Ensure that the user is entering a number when asking for menu items.
#       4) Remove the possibility of duplicate items (and donâ€™t  allow the user to enter too many items).
