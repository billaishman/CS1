Portfolio of programs created in CS1 


Hello!

These are the programs I wrote in CS1.

Morning Routine:
https://github.com/billaishman/CS1/blob/main/Aishman_Bill_morningroutine.py

This program explains a morning routine based on user input. So if the user is asked if it is raining and the user replies “yes” then the program says to bring an umbrella. I made this program to: 

      -Take user input.
      -Give a different answer depending on user input.


Magic 8 Ball:
https://github.com/billaishman/CS1/blob/main/Aishman_Bill_Magic8ball.py

This is a magic 8-ball program. The user asks a question and it gives a random answer. I made this program to:
            -Ask the user a question.
            -Randomly choose from an array.


RPS:
https://github.com/billaishman/CS1/blob/main/Aishman_Bill_rps.py

This is a rock, paper, scissors game. The user enters rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors and determines who wins.  I made this program to:
      -The user can play against the computer.
      -The user can select a “weapon”.
      -A weapon is randomly selected for the computer.
      -Both weapons are displayed.
      -The game determines who wins in each game.
      -There is an option to play again.

Food-o-Matic:
https://github.com/billaishman/CS1/blob/main/Aishman_Bill_Foodomatic.py

This program generates a random combination of food items for a menu. I made this program to:
Use parallel arrays by creating a list for each column below
      -Prompt the user for a number of menu items.
      -Generate that number of menu items.



Function Mashup:
https://github.com/billaishman/CS1/blob/main/Aishman_Bill_functionmash.py

This program is a function mashup that does many things. I made this program to:
      -Two functions to reduce the number of print statements needed to “sing” a song (checkpoint).
      -Takes two numbers and prints their sum.
      -Takes a list and prints every element in that list individually (vertically).
      -Takes a list and an element and returns a boolean determined by whether the element is in the list.
      -Takes in a parameter and returns a boolean determined by whether that parameter is an integer.
      -Prompts the user for two numbers and prints a random number between the two. Use the previous function!
      -Takes a string and two characters, then replaces every instance in the string of the first character with the second (without using string methods). Example: “hello world”, “l”, “a” would return “heaao worad”.


Password keeper:
https://github.com/billaishman/CS1/blob/main/Aishman_Bill_passwordkeeper.py

This program stores websites, user names and password in three parallel arrays. I made this program to: 
      -Create three parallel arrays: (1) websites and their (2) usernames and (3) passwords
      -Prompt the user to enter websites and their usernames and passwords to store in the parallel arrays above.
      -Allow the user to print out the list of websites along with their usernames and passwords.
      -Allow the user to access a specific website’s username and password.
      -Allow the user to end the program.
